# Modelling the effects of virus manipulation of host and vector on plant virus disease epidemics
## PhD project - University of Cambridge, Department of Plant Sciences

### Project summary

Plant viruses are a major threat to worldwide food security, and are usually transmitted via arthropod vectors. Viruses frequently alter their host plant's phenotype in order to influence vector behaviour and virus acquisition and transmission, but further research is needed to fully understand how this can affect epidemic dynamics, and whether it can be exploited for disease control. Mathematical models have contributed to our current understanding of the effects of virus-induced vector preference, but usually ignore potentially important aspects of vector life history and behaviour, and external abiotic factors. I will address these issues through creation of a series of mathematical models, with the aim of application to agricultural disease control.
